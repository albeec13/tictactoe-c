# tictactoe-c
Machine learning tic-tac-toe game in C

Currently implements a rudimentary tic-tac-toe game, with human player going first and AI player going second.  The AI plays randomly, but in the future will 'learn' by keeping a tree structure of played moves and their results and pruning the branches that result in a loss, such that AI will always tie or win.
